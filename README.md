Tech Documentation
==================

Documentation is done on gh-pages branch and static site which is hosted by Github is generated by HUGO.
Only the structure has been added and content is upcoming.
Hugo website used to generate the static documentation is on ```tech-doc``` branch.

Proper workflow to update tech-doc will be introduced.
Right now content on tech-doc branch can be used to generate static site.
After that the content of the public folder need to be put on gh-pages branch so github can server them there.
